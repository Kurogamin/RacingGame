# RacingGame
This is my first ever Unreal Engine project.

I made a simple racing game with gameplay heavly inspired by the game Trackmania. You use arrows to move the car and brake to slow down / drift.

You can choose if you want to finish set amount of laps or set a time after which the game ends and try to get best possible lap time until the end.

Touching grass slows you down and adds time to red "time lost" counter. When comparing with other lap times, time lost is added to lap time.

# Controls
Movement - Arrow keys

Brake    - Space / "S"

Cameras  - "1" / "2" / "3" / "4"
